# JWT-django

<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-web-token-jwt/">JSON Web Token </a>is an open standard for securely transferring data within parties using a JSON object. JWT is used for stateless authentication mechanisms for users and providers, this means maintaining session is on the client-side instead of storing sessions on the server. Here, we will implement the JWT authentication system in Django.
